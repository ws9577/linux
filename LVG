Key Advantages of LVM
Dynamic Resizing:

Logical volumes (LVs) can be resized easily, even when they are in use (depending on the filesystem). This is much harder to do with standard partitions. With LVM, you can extend or shrink volumes without unmounting or rebooting.
You can dynamically allocate more space to a filesystem when needed, without repartitioning.
Snapshots:

LVM allows you to take snapshots of your volumes, which can be useful for backups or testing system changes. A snapshot captures the state of a filesystem at a particular point in time, allowing for easy rollbacks.
Multiple Physical Disks:

LVM lets you combine multiple physical drives or partitions into a single volume group (VG). This enables you to create logical volumes that span across multiple disks, effectively aggregating disk space.
This also supports RAID-like setups (striping, mirroring) for better performance or redundancy, all within LVM.
Flexible Storage Management:

LVM makes it easy to manage disk space in a way that can be more flexible than traditional partitions. You can allocate more storage space to partitions that need it over time, without repartitioning.
You can also easily move LVs between different storage devices without downtime (pvmove).
Redundancy and Performance:

LVM supports RAID-like capabilities. You can stripe LVs across multiple disks for increased performance or mirror them for redundancy.

Benefits of Using LVM for QEMU KVM VMs:
Dynamic Resizing (Expanding or Shrinking)

Expanding a VM’s disk: If a virtual machine runs out of space, you can easily extend the logical volume (LV) assigned to the VM, and then resize the filesystem within the VM.
Shrinking is a bit more complex but still possible. While shrinking a filesystem must be done carefully (and some filesystems don’t support it easily), LVM gives you the flexibility to manage disk space dynamically.
Snapshots for Backups and Testing

You can take snapshots of logical volumes used by your VMs. This is very useful for creating backups or testing changes, allowing you to revert to a previous state if needed.
Snapshots are fast and efficient in LVM since they only store changes made after the snapshot is taken.
Performance

LVM allows for striping across multiple physical volumes, which can improve disk I/O performance for VMs. This is particularly useful if your VMs are doing a lot of disk reads and writes.
You can distribute the storage of a single logical volume across multiple disks, balancing load and improving performance.
Efficient Disk Usage

You can create thin-provisioned LVs, allowing multiple virtual machines to share the same pool of storage without allocating all the space up front. This helps avoid wasting space on unused storage, which can happen when allocating static-sized disk images for VMs.
Thin provisioning allows you to overcommit storage by allocating more virtual space than is physically available, growing volumes only as they fill up.
Easier Backup and Migration

LVM makes it easier to move or migrate virtual machines between different physical drives without downtime (using pvmove).
You can also manage VM backups more efficiently by copying the logical volumes or taking snapshots before backup operations.
Example Use Case: Expanding VM Disk Space
If a VM's disk is running out of space and is stored on an LVM logical volume, you can do the following:

-----------------------------

# Extend the logical volume on the host:
sudo lvextend -L +20G /dev/ubuntu-vg/vm_disk_lv

# Resize the filesystem within the VM (assuming ext4):
sudo resize2fs /dev/vda1  # From inside the VM

-----------------------------------
Key Points to Consider When Using LVM for Multiple VMs:
Separate Logical Volumes for Each VM:

Each VM should have its own logical volume. While the volume group (VG) can be shared across multiple VMs, each VM should use its own logical volume (LV) to avoid conflicts.
If both VMs are trying to use the same LV, the second VM would fail to start because the disk is already mounted or in use by the first VM.
Thin Provisioning:

You can use thin-provisioned logical volumes to avoid over-allocating space upfront. Thin provisioning allows multiple VMs to share the same storage pool, but only use physical disk space as they actually consume it.
This can help you create multiple VMs from a single pool without fully committing the storage for each at the time of creation.
Example of creating a thin pool and then VMs within it:
# Create a thin pool
sudo lvcreate --size 100G --thinpool ubuntu-vg/thinpool

# Create a thin-provisioned LV for each VM
sudo lvcreate --thin --name vm1 --virtualsize 20G ubuntu-vg/thinpool
sudo lvcreate --thin --name vm2 --virtualsize 20G ubuntu-vg/thinpool

# Here, even though each VM can "see" 20 GB, the actual disk space used only grows as the VMs write to the disk.

# Ensure There’s Enough Space in the Volume Group:
# If the volume group (VG) doesn't have enough free space, it could cause the second VM to fail to start. Check the available space in the VG:
sudo vgdisplay ubuntu-vg

# Creating Logical Volumes for Multiple VMs: To ensure that each VM has its own logical volume, follow these steps:
# Create a separate LV for each VM:
sudo lvcreate -L 20G -n vm1 ubuntu-vg
sudo lvcreate -L 20G -n vm2 ubuntu-vg

# Check If the LVs Are in Use: If the storage space is reported as "occupied," verify that it's not already being used by another running VM or mounted by the host system:
sudo lvs
