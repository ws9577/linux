# Automating LVM Expansion

# Hereâ€™s a basic approach to achieve this:
# Monitor disk usage: Use a command like df to check disk usage. If usage exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 90%), trigger the extension.
# Auto-expand script: You could write a script that performs the LVM expansion automatically if the usage exceeds your threshold.

#!/bin/bash

# Set threshold for disk usage
THRESHOLD=90
LV_PATH="/dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv"

# Get current disk usage as a percentage
USAGE=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//g')

if [ "$USAGE" -ge "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
  echo "Disk usage is above threshold ($THRESHOLD%), extending LV..."
  # Extend LV by 10G, you can customize this
  sudo lvextend -L +10G $LV_PATH
  # Resize the filesystem
  sudo resize2fs $LV_PATH
  echo "LV and filesystem extended by 10G"
else
  echo "Disk usage is below threshold"
fi


# Set Up Cron Job
